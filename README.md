# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe AlphaZero + DTW

A hybrid AI for Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe combining AlphaZero (ResNet + MCTS) with Distance to Win (DTW) endgame solver.

## Key Features

- **AlphaZero**: Deep ResNet with SE attention + Monte Carlo Tree Search
- **DTW (Distance to Win)**: Alpha-Beta complete search for endgame positions
- **Hybrid Search**: Pure MCTS with cache-only DTW lookup, shallow Alpha-Beta for midgame candidates, complete search for endgame

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

```bash
python train.py
```

### Inference

```python
from ai.prediction import create_prediction_agent, create_strong_agent

# Standard agent (400 simulations)
agent = create_prediction_agent(model_path="./model/model_final.pth")

# Strong agent (800 simulations, lower temperature)
agent = create_strong_agent(model_path="./model/model_final.pth")

# Play a move
from game import Board
board = Board()
action = agent.select_action(board, temperature=0)
row, col = action // 9, action % 9
```

## Search Strategy

```
Opening (46-81 empty cells):
└─ Pure MCTS + Neural Network policy/value

Midgame (16-45 empty cells):
├─ MCTS with cache-only DTW lookup (O(1), no search overhead)
├─ Self-play: Shallow Alpha-Beta (depth=8) checks candidate moves
├─ Winning move found → select immediately
└─ Losing moves → exclude from candidates

Endgame (≤15 empty cells):
├─ Complete Alpha-Beta search (self-play level)
├─ MCTS: Cache lookup only (reuses self-play DTW results)
├─ Transposition table with 8-fold symmetry (D4 group)
└─ Winning position + DTW≤5 → use optimal move directly
```

### MCTS + DTW Cache Integration

MCTS does NOT perform DTW searches during tree expansion (which would cause exponential slowdown).
Instead, it uses **cache-only lookup**:

1. Self-play generates games and caches DTW results in transposition table
2. MCTS checks cache for endgame positions (O(1) lookup)
3. Cache hit → Use exact DTW value instead of network prediction
4. Cache miss → Use network prediction (no search penalty)

## Neural Network Architecture

```
Input: 7 channels × 9×9
├─ Ch 0: Current player stones
├─ Ch 1: Opponent player stones
├─ Ch 2: Won sub-boards (current player perspective)
├─ Ch 3: Lost sub-boards (current player perspective)
├─ Ch 4: Drawn sub-boards
├─ Ch 5: Last move position
└─ Ch 6: Valid sub-board mask (where next move is allowed)

Backbone: ResNet with SE attention
├─ 30 residual blocks
├─ 512 channels
└─ Squeeze-and-Excitation (reduction=16)

Dual Heads:
├─ Policy Head: Conv 1×1 → FC → 81 outputs (softmax)
└─ Value Head: Conv 1×1 → FC → FC → 1 output (tanh)
```

## DTW Endgame Solver

The Distance to Win (DTW) calculator provides perfect play in endgame positions:

- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Minimax search with alpha-beta cutoffs
- **Move Ordering**: Center → corners → edges priority for better pruning
- **Transposition Table**: Hot/Cold 2-tier LRU cache
  - Hot cache: Fast access, no compression (5M entries)
  - Cold cache: Compressed to 3 bytes per entry (20M entries)
- **Symmetry Normalization**: Canonical board representation using D4 group (8x memory savings)

## Position Weighting

The training pipeline uses weighted sampling to focus learning on critical game phases:

```
Empty Cells | Weight | Category
------------|--------|------------------
50+         | 1.0    | Opening
40-49       | 1.0    | Early Mid
30-39       | 1.0    | Mid
26-29       | 1.2    | ★ Transition (Most Important)
20-25       | 1.0    | Near Endgame
10-19       | 0.6    | Endgame
0-9         | 0.4    | Deep Endgame
```

**Rationale**:
- **Transition (26-29 cells)**: Critical decision point where games are often decided. Higher weight ensures more training focus.
- **Near Endgame (20-25 cells)**: Shallow Alpha-Beta only (DTW threshold=15). NN guidance still important, so standard weight.
- **Endgame (10-19 cells)**: DTW provides perfect solutions, reduced weight but still maintains pattern learning.
- **Deep Endgame (0-9 cells)**: DTW solves completely, but some weight retained for NN to learn endgame patterns for MCTS initial evaluation.

The `WeightedSampleBuffer` implements O(1) weighted sampling using cumulative weights and numpy random choice.

## Training Strategy

### Adaptive Scheduling

Training uses progressive scheduling to optimize learning efficiency:

```
Progress   | Simulations | Games | Temperature
-----------|-------------|-------|------------
0-20%      | 200         | 83    | 1.0 (exploration)
20-50%     | 380         | 133   | 1.0
50-80%     | 560         | 183   | 0.65
80-100%    | 800         | 250   | 0.3 (exploitation)
```

**Rationale**:
- **Early training**: Network is near-random, so fewer games/sims suffice. High temperature encourages diverse exploration.
- **Mid training**: Gradual increase as network improves and data quality matters more.
- **Late training**: Maximum resources for fine-tuning with low temperature for precise play.

### Training Loop

Each iteration:
1. **Self-play**: Generate games using current network + MCTS + DTW
2. **Replay buffer**: Add samples with phase-based weights
3. **Training**: Sample weighted batch, train for 40 epochs
4. **Checkpoint**: Save model every 20 iterations and DTW cache every 10 iterations to huggingface

### Replay Buffer

- Size: 1,000,000 samples (sliding window)
- Sampling: Weighted by game phase (transition positions prioritized)
- Accumulation: Data persists across iterations for diversity

## Configuration

```python
# config.py defaults
NetworkConfig:
    num_res_blocks: 30
    num_channels: 512

TrainingConfig:
    num_iterations: 300
    num_self_play_games: 250
    num_simulations: 800 (adaptive: 200→800)
    batch_size: 4096
    lr: 0.002
    use_amp: True  # Mixed precision

DTWConfig:
    endgame_threshold: 15   # Complete search threshold
    midgame_threshold: 45   # Shallow search threshold
    shallow_depth: 8        # Midgame search depth limit
    hot_cache_size: 5M
    cold_cache_size: 20M
```

## Optimizations

- **Fast Board.clone()**: Manual copy vs deepcopy (80x faster)
- **Node clone elimination**: Avoid double cloning in MCTS expansion
- **Cache-only DTW in MCTS**: O(1) lookup, no search overhead
- **is_terminal caching**: Memoized terminal state detection
- **Symmetry normalization**: 8x cache memory savings via D4 group
- **Mixed Precision (AMP)**: FP16 training for 2x memory efficiency
- **Adaptive simulations**: Start with 200 sims, increase to 800 as training progresses

python -m pytest test/ -v
